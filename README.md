So before today, we haven't been updating this, we're sorry! Here's what's
been done so far: we have a basic element class (Jude) and a working function
class that would calculate v-i relationships (Tejas). Later we hope to get
cross-component absolute voltage calculations functional, and Tejas will start
work on a "component" that would act like a resistor, to test the class
structure

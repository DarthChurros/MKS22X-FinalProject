# MKS22X-FinalProject
A Processing-based circuit simulator

Sunday 5/19: 
Jude: This was the first day so I initialized all of the basic classes and added constructors and the structure of the simulator.


Monday 5/20:
Jude: I added different methods to resistor but branched off to focus on component.


5/22/19
So before today, we haven't been updating this, we're sorry! Here's what's
been done so far: we have a basic element class (Jude) and a working function
class that would calculate v-i relationships (Tejas). Later we hope to get
cross-component absolute voltage calculations functional, and Tejas will start
work on a "component" that would act like a resistor, to test the class
structure


Thursday 5/23:I worked heavily and almost finished resistor and voltSource, decided to eliminate the polarSource class and started working on some of the circuit class methods in order to calculate the voltage in the circuit.
